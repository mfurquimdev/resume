Hi, my name is Mateus Furquim, and I am a software engineer with over 8 years of experience in the field.

I have always been enthusiastic about Artificial Intelligence ever since my under graduation studies.
One of my projects at Universidade de Bras√≠lia was a web application where you submit an image, and it returns other images by similarity. This project uses the Django web framework for the back-end, the Bootstrap framework for the front-end, and the K next neighbours algorithm to select the closest images.

At my current role, I design, implement and maintain more than twenty micro services to estimate the energy consumption of each house appliance using machine learning algorithms developed by the research team.
