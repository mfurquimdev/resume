Design, implementation and maintainance of more than twenty microservices to estimate the energy consumption of each house appliance using machine learning algorithms developed by the research team.

- Designing, development and implementation of proof of concept and production-ready middleware and back-end services.
- Debugging and troubleshooting deployed middleware and back-end services.
- Creation of extensible, modular middleware/back-end services to be used by other layers.
- Research and development in a variety of problem domains.
- Source code documentation and properly adherence to security guidance and compliance with coding standards.

Improved the performance in writing to a NoSQL database up to 75% by understanding the usage of unlogged batches and separating the data by the partition keys.

## Most recent back-end development project
My most recent back-end development project is a complex network of several micro-services that employ machine learning algorithms to estimate house appliances' energy consumption.

In the course of three years, we have experimented with different Python web frameworks, such as Flask, and Tornado, before finally settling for FastAPI due to the fast development cycle we get from it.

For the Database, we use four different kinds, depending on the requirements. Throughout my journey at DevGrid, I have worked with PostgreSQL (SQL), Cassandra (NoSQL), Redis (key-value) and S3 (object storage).

The back-end services I have maintained the most utilizes the framework FastAPI and all four types of Database. It also interacts with a few Java services through a REST API.

I was also partly responsible for: managing the Machine Learning library versioning and deployment; managing the CI/CD pipeline at GitLab; and generating metrics for Prometheus and tracing for Jaeger, as well as creating Grafana Dashboards.
