At CanAssist, I was hired in January for Co-op program at University of Victoria.
I worked until April and did a couple more days on weekend for an exposition of the projects we developed inside.
I worked in a couple different projects.


# Elderly Home

The first one was an embedded system capable of identifying different events through security devices, which emitted Z-Waves.
The event would reach the BeagleBone Black or Raspberry Pi via a Z-Wave receptor.
The device was capable of making a call to a registered number.
When the person accepted the call, a menu written in Asterisk would be played.


## Social

The elderly care system notifies a relative.

Improve the quality of life for elderly people and people with physical or mental disabilities.

Many elderly people reach a point when a few tasks become gradually difficult, until it no longer makes sense to...

Some elderly people have difficulty distinguishing day and night.
At times, they leave their houses at 2 am expecting to have an open coffee shop as if it were day time.

Relieve the worry of the elderly relatives by letting them know if the door has been open in between night hours.

## Technical 

The device was also capable to convert Text to Speech. This way, we could generate dynamically the name of the person.

%% Log rotate logic inside Raspberry Pi using Qt framework.
%% Maintained a low resource consumption of Raspberry Pi by log rotating 
Accomplished a low resource consumption of a Raspberry Pi by rotating log using C language and Qt Framework.
Maintained the time of the Raspberry Pi by communicating with a Real Time Clock module through their GPIO pins.


Setup an entire configuration via a phone call to the Raspberry Pi.
The menus were written using the Asterisk framework with a Text to Speech capabilities.

Developed an entire configuration using the Asterisk framework with a Text to Speech capabilities via a phone call to the Raspberry Pi.


Helped the team finish the project two weeks earlier than estimate.



Improved the quality of life for elderly people by allowing them to live by themselves regardless of their probable inability to tell between day and night.




Detects events sent by a security device through Z-Wave protocol.
The embedded system receives an alert when the device detects a Z-Wave event.
