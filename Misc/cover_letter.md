With over 8 years of experience in backend development and Linux systems administration, I have broad experience with Python-based web applications usins FastAPI, and the build and deployment process for business-critical web applications at scale. I have also administered Linux-based servers or VMs in cloud environments and worked with popular AWS cloud services, including EC2, RDS, and Lambda.

In my previous roles, I have contributed to the architecture planning/design process and helped lead a team of engineers to craft high-quality, well-tested software with predictable, healthy agile processes. I have also worked with various RDBMS and key-value store databases, and I am knowledgeable of the common patterns in SQL queries and query optimizations.

I am confident that my experience and technical skills align with the role responsibilities of a Senior Integration Engineer at your company.
