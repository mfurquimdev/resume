Detection of masked malicious packet using network intrusion detection system (IDS) with unsupervised machine learning.

Wrote the documentation of DogZilla - an Intrusion Detection System, which enhances the Snort capabilities.

Enhance flow of potential malicious packets


2 Debian servers
- notification
- processing and storage

network mirroring


[Snort](https://www.snort.org/) captures the packets and generates alerts based on static rules
[Barnyard2](https://github.com/firnsy/barnyard2) is a dedicated spooler for Snort's unified2 binary output format.
Allowing Snort to run at full speed


DogZilla is a combination of Snort capturing packets, Barnyard2 spooling, and unsupervised machine learning.

Capture packets using wireshark to replay them as `.pcaps` in a controlled environment

Hadoop for distributed processing

Configured Hadoop for training a K-Means model using distributed processing


The project was
Enhanced the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with unsupervised machine learning to be used by the Brazilian Army during the 2016 Olympic Games at Rio de Janeiro
Together with the Brazilian Army,
created experiments for a distributed processing IDS system, which enhances the Snort capabilities by training an unsupervised machine learning model using K-Means algorithm. 

Wrote more than 1500 pages of documentation for a distributed processing system that uses

Successfully detected masked malicious network packets using K-Means algorithm and distributed processing with Spark and Hadoop

Enhanced the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with unsupervised machine learning to detect masked malicious network packets



Configured a Debian server to capture all network packets in promiscuous mode using Wireshark as `.pcaps` and replay them in a controlled environment
